            </h2>
        <p> I have always desired more out of life,
             I just didn't know it would come in
              the form of becoming a web developer.
             </p>
        <p>
            My background is in early childcare development
             and my persuit to becoming a developer comes from my 
             desire to solve problems. One of my goals are to help foster STEM in the youth as technology changes everything
             by teaching code to the future generation.
