        <p> I have always desired more out of life,
             I just didn't know it would come in,
              the form of becoming a web developer.

        <p>
            My backgroung is in early childcare
             and my persuit to becoming a developer comes from my 
             desire to solve problems and help foster STEM in the youth as technology changes everything.
